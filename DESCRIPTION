Description: Succinctly and correctly format statistical summaries of
    various models and tests (F-test, Chi-Sq-test, Fisher-test, T-test, and rank-significance).  The main purpose is unified reporting 
    of experimental results, working around issue such as the difficulty of
    extracting model summary facts (such as with 'lm'/'glm').  This package also
    includes empirical tests, such as bootstrap estimates.
